## How to compile
gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic<br/>
___gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh___
## More Info
All files are formatted in Betty style and checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
All header files are guarded
## Example
##### The shell should work like this in interactive mode:<br/>
*$ ./hsh*<br/>
*($) /bin/ls*<br/>
*hsh main.c shell.c*<br/>
*($)*<br/>
*($) exit*<br/>
*$*<br/>

##### Also like this in non-interactive mode:<br/>
*$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh*<br/>
*hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2*<br/>
*$*<br/>
*$ cat test_ls_2*<br/>
*/bin/ls*<br/>
*/bin/ls*<br/>
*$*<br/>
*$ cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh*<br/>
*hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2*<br/>
*hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2*<br/>
*$*<br/>
